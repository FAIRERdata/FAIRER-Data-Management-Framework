# FAIRER Data Management Framework

A data management framework is a model of the people, policies, standards, and processes needed to manage data. It includes corporate strategy and objectives, data strategy, capabilities, governance, data management, metadata management, documentation (e.g., machine-actionable data management plan (maDMP), data dictionnary), data architecture, data lifecycle, and deliverables. The result is the production of FAIRER (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, Ethical, and Reproducible) data.
