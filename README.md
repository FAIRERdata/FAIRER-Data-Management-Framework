# FAIRER Data Management Framework

A data management framework is a model of the people, policies, standards, and processes needed to manage data. It includes corporate strategy and objectives, data strategy, capabilities, governance, data management, metadata management, data architecture, machine-actionable data management plan (maDMP), and data lifecycle. The result is the production of FAIRER (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, Ethical, and Reproducible) data.
